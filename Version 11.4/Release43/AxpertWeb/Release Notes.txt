Product Enhancement:
-----------------------
1)TASK-4763 ARM - Create microservices for existing ARM
* ARM application is converted into microservices for improved performance, scalability and less release impact due to changes in other modules.
* The ARM url is changed to multiple Microservice URLs based on the functionality/modules.
* Appsettings.ini should be placed/replaced in the main root ARM folder. It should not be placed inside the microservice application folders. 
* New HTTP Get api ValidateAppSettings is released to validate appsettings of ARM from browser level.

Curl for ValidateAppSettings HTTPGET API:
curl --location 'http://localhost/ARM_site2/ARM_APIs/api/v1/ValidateAppSettings?appname=pgbase114' \
--data ''

IIS Configuration:
------------------
* Either  Manual IIS configuration for this app is avaiable in the document 
ARM_Microservices_IIS_Manual_Hosting_Guide.docx
(or)
* Batch file for "One click IIS installation for ARM Microservices" is avaiable in the release folder. Go through "ARM_Microservices_IIS_Hosting_Via_BATCH_Installer_Guide.docx" for more details.

* Sample postman collection for the APIs is available in "ARM Microservice APIs.postman_collection.json" file.

Note to solutions team:
------------------
Anyone using the ARM apis like SendSignalR, ARMPushToQueue, ExecuteAPIs,  from external apps / DB routines should change the ARM URL with the respective microservice URLs.

TASK-4769 -BMRCL- Attachments with formats such as (.ifc , .dwg, .etc...) some more formats are saved correctly to the file server path,
but when we try accessed through iView or TStruct,it does not allow file ( download or preview) .
but for other format like (xlsx,pdf,doc,txt,png,ect.. ) it is working . 
Developer option :
       Property: Allow Specific File Types in Attachments
       Property Code: Allow Specific File Types in Attachments
       Property Value: true/false
       Property Info: Comma separated file types need to be mentioned (ex.: zip, rar,mp3,mp4,ifc,msg)
       Form/Report: ALL Forms / Single Form
       User Role: All / Single role	
Note to QA & Solution Team:
1. AxpertWeb apps will not allow special file types like zip, rar,mp3,mp4 and ifc because of security reasons. But as per the business requirement any type files can be uploaded by using the above mentioned developer option. 
2. Even though special file types can be uploaded by using above mentioned developer option, IIS will block when downloading it as per the security reason. So, if the business requirement required to download these type of files, the below setting needs to be done at application level. 
  a. Site level IIS tab( AxpertWeb and AxpertWebScripts sites), The option 'MIME Types' needs to be open and add the required file types(ex.: zip, rar,mp3,mp4,ifc,msg), if it is not already exist.
  Ex.: 1. File name extension: .ifc
          MIME type: application/x-step , application/vnd.ms-outlook
       2. File name extension: .msg
          MIME type: application/vnd.ms-outlook
       3. File name extension: .zip
          MIME type: application/x-zip-compressed
3. If the file size is more than 27 MB, please make sure the following settings as has been changed as follows.
   a. In IIS settings goto Request Filtering and click on Edit Feature Settings 
   b. Change the value of 'Maximum allowed content length (in KB)' to '536870912'
