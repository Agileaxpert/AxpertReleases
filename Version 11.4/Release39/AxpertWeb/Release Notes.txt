TASK-4181 -- Enhancement: ARMExportService has been converted to Window Worker process services named 'ARMExportWorkerService'.
Please note that with this enhancement, the FIFO nature of the Export Consumer service has been changed to support concurrent user export requests. As a result, if a large file takes longer to export, smaller files can finish earlier even while the larger export request is still in progress.
Below points needs to be noted related to this new consumer program.
Note: 1. The service needs to be started with the following command in command prompt.
         Service Start command ex.:
          sc create ARMExportWorkerService binPath= "D:\ExportService\ARMExportWorkerService.exe D:\ExportService\appsettings.json"
          sc start ARMExportWorkerService  
      2. This service wanted to stop or remove from the windows service needs to be run below command.
          Ex.: sc stop ARMExportWorkerService
               sc delete ARMExportWorkerService   
      3. Please follow for Linux to start this consumer service. 
          a. Create a folder for your service:
              /home/ubuntu/ARMExportWorkerService/
          b. Create the systemd service file
              sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/ARMExportWorkerService.service
          c. Reload system
              sudo systemctl daemon-reload
          d. Enable the service at boot
              sudo systemctl enable ARMExportWorkerService
          e. Start the service
              sudo systemctl start ARMExportWorkerService
          f. Check status
              sudo systemctl status ARMExportWorkerService
          g. To STOP / RESTART the service
              sudo systemctl stop ARMExportWorkerService
              sudo systemctl restart ARMExportWorkerService
