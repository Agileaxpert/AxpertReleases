TASK-2718 -Payazzure- Product Issue & Reported by "Payazzure" Team: When transid is uppercase and case-sensitive based forms are published from the source to the target using the Publish Listing, and those forms are assigned to a non-default user, an error appears when the non-default user logs in and opens the form: “Oops! Error occurred due to the following reason: Root element is missing.” In the database, under the AXUSERACCESS table, the sname column stores the transid in lowercase, which causes the issue.

Note: Once the notification is generated, if the user first loads the record through the Active List and then opens it via the SignalR notification, the record loads correctly.
