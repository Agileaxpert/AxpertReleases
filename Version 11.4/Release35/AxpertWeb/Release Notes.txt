               sc stop ARMRapidSaveWorkerService
               sc delete ARMRapidSaveWorkerService

            Linux:
              a. Create a folder for your service:
               /home/ubuntu/RapidSaveService/
              b. Create the systemd service file
               sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/RapidSaveService.service
              c. Reload system
               sudo systemctl daemon-reload
              d. Enable the service at boot
               sudo systemctl enable RapidSaveService
               e. Start the service
               sudo systemctl start RapidSaveService
              f. Check status
