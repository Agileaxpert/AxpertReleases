TASK-0239 -Support(Kotecha)- After applying patch version 11.3_R21, file attachments added through the TStruct grid are not retained after saving the record.
Before saving, the attachment folder is correctly created, and all uploaded files are visible as expected.
After saving, the original files are deleted. Instead, a new temporary folder is created inside the attachment path, which contains only a one-line text file.
